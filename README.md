# Second Machine Learning meeting(Updated Nov 13 22:00)

## HomeWork:
> Dear Class:
> ---- You can finish these assignments with your partners or using search engine.Everyone needs to pay attention to __third assignments__ and send code to my email(rayestgeeta2018@gmail.com).Due 12/1 12:00 AM. The code files must be `.ipynb`. When you submit your homework, I will reply you `Got`.
>  1. Everyone should download all the code mentioned in this meeting, and then try your best to understand each line of code and run them. Encourage yourself to try to change the parameters of those algorithms and see what is interesting. 
>  2. Everyone needs to understand the basic ideas of the six algorithms (`KNN, linear, logisit, DT, SVM, Naive Bayes`). You need to summarize the different scenarios of the six algorithms and understand the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm.
>  3. Please __try to write__ a machine learning algorithm. What you need to do is to solve _handwritten numeral recognition_. We have explained this dataset in detail(in `Brief-introduction.ipynb`). Now your task is to try to solve this problem with different machine learning algorithm models. Your goal is to tighten the final score of your model to 100. I hope you will pay attention to what I have been emphasizing. You are encouraged to visualize the learning curve of your model. I encourage you to compare and analyze the results of different models. Finally, you need to hand in your code (hoping to __annotate__ and pay attention to your __code style__).

# First machine learning meeting.

## HomeWork:
> Dear Class:
> ---- You can finish these assignments with your partners or using search engine.Everyone needs to pay attention to __third assignments__ and send code to my email(rayestgeeta2018@gmail.com).Due 11/11 12:00 AM. The code files must be `.ipynb`.
>  1. Everyone needs to create a `GitHub` account. Then publish a issue on my GithHub's Regular-meeting-Homework'Issues.(Anything content is OK).
>  2. Download all the code files from today's regular meeting from my GitHub.(Theory_Basic and Brief-introduction.).Then try to run this code (that's easy.)and review this meeting.
>  3. Everyone needs to learn to use python in `Jupyter Notebook`(exited in Anaconda).If you don°Øt use python at all, please write python codes in `Jupyter notebook`.(You need to seed your practice code to me.)If you have been able to use python skillfully, please try to study `Numpy   Pandas  Matplotlib  Sklearn`(This is not necessary. If you can, please send it to me.). If you are proficient in the above, please study today's machine learning code and other machine learning algorithms.

## Recommended courses and books.
> - [Œ‚∂˜¥Ôª˙∆˜—ßœ∞ ”∆µ](https://study.163.com/course/courseMain.htm?courseId=1004570029)(It is biased towards the derivation of mathematical knowledge, but it is still quite useful.)
> - [ ˝æ›∑÷Œˆ”Îª˙∆˜—ßœ∞…œ](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av30300809)
> - [ ˝æ›∑÷Œˆ”Îª˙∆˜—ßœ∞œ¬](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av30350558) (It is biased towards the interpretation of ideas and codes.)
> - Books about Python are available in library books. But please pay attention to borrowing books, please read the directory carefully, and then choose __python3__ version. If you want to buy books, I haven't found the suitable choice.

## Some website about Ubuntu.
> - [Ubuntu18.04 ∞≤◊∞∫Û”¶∏√◊ˆµƒ ¬](https://blog.csdn.net/hymanjack/article/details/80285400)(Ignore 13.)
> - [Ubuntu ÷–Œƒ¬€Ã≥](http://forum.ubuntu.org.cn/)
## Introduce:

>  - First, I talked about the boundaries between __artificial intelligence,machine learning and deep learning__.It is very important to distinguish them.
>  - Then, I introduced some basic knowledge of machine learning. 
>   >  1. Overfitting and Underfitting.
>   >  2. Cost Function.
>   >  3. Accuracy.
>   >  4. Learning curve.
>   >  5. Algorithm model optimization.
>   
> (The above contents and codes are in `Theory_Basic.ipynb`.)

## An example of machine learning.
>  We use `Digits datasets` to experience the whole process of machine learning. 
>   >  1. Introduction of Digits datasets.
>   >  2. Features selection.
>   >  3. Data cleaning.
>   >  4. Model selection(We choose SVM).
>   >  5. Model training.
>   >  6. Model test.
>   >  7. Model save and load.
